Dotfiles managed with chezmoi. These dots are mainly meant for my personal setups and learning. Your mileage may vary.

These dotfiles have been created, tested, and used using Arch linux. I do not guarantee other distros will work.

Usage:
1. Install chezmoi with the method of your choosing (https://www.chezmoi.io/)
2. Use:
  `chezmoi init https://github.com/UtriainenJ/dotfiles.git`
* Optionally to view the changes:
  `chezmoi diff`
3. To apply the dots
  `chezmoi apply`
